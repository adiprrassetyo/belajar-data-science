Context : The development of the telecommunications industry is now very fast. This behavior has led to the number of telecommunication companies and the increase of internet service providers which can lead to competition between providers.

This switch can lead to reduced revenue for telecommunications companies so it is important to handle.

Problem Statement : This prediction is important for companies to know so that they can map out a business strategy to retain customers.
